Typescript: programming language, alternative to javascript.
It is superset to javascript.

Browsers by default do not understand typescript.
So we have to complile it down into javascript, in order 
to understand it.

Advantages and features:
Allows us to use string types, say a string number, string. Less error prone.
Javascript uses dynamic types where variables can change types, it can lead to more errors.

We can use arroes functions, destructuring in typescript.

Extra features like generics, interfaces and tuples etc, that are not there in javascript.

tsc => tyescript compiler
npm i -g typescript to install compiler globally

Command for compilation
tsc <filename.ts>

Basically to start compilation in watch mode.
